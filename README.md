# Dogwalker
*Created by DT* 
Q1 
Part A
The first question in this folder is creating a method that return that amount of dogs the dogwalker is walking during a specfic hour. It first gets the amount of dogs that could be walked in that hour. Then it will compare it to the maximum amount of dogs the dog walker could possible walk at that hour. There is an if statment that if the dogwalker can walk all the dog in that hour then they will reserved these dogd and update the amount of dogs ready to be walk. If it not true then they will walk the maximum amount of dogs that dog walk can actually walk and update the amount of dogs ready to br walk 

Part B

This part calculates the amount of money the dog walker earn after working for a certain amount of time. Also there is some condtion that a person can get 3 more dollar if they are walking the maximum amount of dogs they can walk or walking during a certian time period. As each hour pass by in which the dogwalk work they well get paid and when the loop ends it will return the total amount of money earned   

Q2
In this folder I created a whole class for SignedText. In that class I created a constructor that stores a person first and last name. Later I created many methods that return a signature and if there is no first name it just return the last name. My other methods edit a signature base on certian factors. 

Q3 

Part A
I create a loop that goes through all names of the string array and add it to the array list that was created in that class. Also while adding these new names into into the array list it also give the place of the player depedning on where the person names was located in the array string.

Part B
I created a new array list which is to show which players will compete each other. If the old array list size is even then no one is spared from the competition round while when the array list size is odd the first place player will not have to compete. While the rest of the players will have to compete each other.

Q4

Part A
Creates a 2d array depending on the input that the user gave. After creating the 2d array I created two loops that goes through every place in the 2d array. Each place will be a number that was randomly pick between 1 and 9.

Part B
It goes through certian parts of the 2d array depending on the input the user gave. There are conditions which will make the check value a false or turn the object in the 2d array into the number 0. Finally it will return a true or false statment depending on what is in the 2d array.
